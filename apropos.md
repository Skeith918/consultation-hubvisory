If you can carry it to the top of the mountain, you may find what you were looking for in the first place.

        			But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on.

                    After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror. It's like putting on a mask.
